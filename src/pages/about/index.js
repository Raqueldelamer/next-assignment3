    <h1>ABOUT</h1> 
    <p>All the images are captured by Raquel Marie with a Canon Power Shot SX, an analog Minolta Xd 11, an Olympus OM-D, or an iPhone.</p>
    
    <p>Inspired and influenced by street photography during the late 19th century to the early and mid 20th century, Raquel Marieâ€™s personal style of photography is predominately black and white, as I feel that it makes my photographs look timeless with more of a focus on shadows, natural light, and composition. 
    Within her photographs, she aspires to take each viewer on a trip to the past, to a time when technology and artificial intelligence were still unimaginable.
